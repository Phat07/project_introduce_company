        "description": "Virtual PBX is no longer a unfamiliar term in the era of Industry 4.0, with technologies such as VoIP, AI, Big Data, IoT, etc., contributing to advancing the voice sector in general and customer service in particular. It helps reduce deployment costs and call expenses by over 80%, while significantly minimizing customer service time. A virtual PBX is a telephone service that uses the internet over an IP network instead of traditional phone lines. What’s particularly special is that the cloud-based virtual PBX operates on a cloud platform, with connections made via IP (network address), making installation straightforward—just requiring an internet connection and devices like IP Phones, computers or laptops (calls can be made via a website or softphone app), or smartphones (with an installed app). As long as there’s internet access, the PBX can be accessed anytime, anywhere.",
